From SBA's Marketing SOP
- 
As a firm in SBA's Federal Contracting Program, you MAY use the SBA-GCBD ICON on your business’s website, business cards, social media profiles, and in your capability statements and proposal bids. 

However, you MAY NOT use the digital icon to express or imply endorsement of any goods, services,  entities, or individuals.  Thus, they may not be used on a company’s letterhead, marketing materials or advertising, whether paid or PSA, traditional or digital.
